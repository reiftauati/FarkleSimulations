Farkle is a silly dice game played with 6 die.
I will not attempt to explain it at this point, 
but the simple idea is that its basically 
POKER meets dice, trying to get the best combinations
of die with the six dice. 

I wanted to simulate 1 billion dice rolls in order
to figure out what the probabilities of certain "hands"
were, and also helping the user to decide if they should
"keep their points" or "keep rolling".

Its a silly game and a silly simulation. 
If you love farkle, you will love this simulation.
